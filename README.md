## Development Instructions
*To do any frontend development, you will have to open 2 terminals and launch both the frontend
and the backend.

### Frontend
- To launch the frontend server, cd into frontend and run **make startdev**. This should launch 
  the frontend in browser. Updates to files should be live (although slightly delayed), because
  of the WATCHPACK_POLLING=true setting in the frontend/package.json "startdev" script.

### Backend
- To launch the backend server, cd into backend and run **make startdev**. This should launch
  the backend in browser. Updates to files should be live.
